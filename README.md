## B. 💵 Sales System

| Product Name | Price   | Quantity | Amount   |
|--------------|---------|----------|----------|
| xxx          | xxx     | xxx      | xxx.xx   |
| **Total Amount** |         |          | **xxx.xx** |


### 💡 Formula:
Total Amount Purchase = (Total Amount + VAT) – Discount (if any)
VAT = 10% of Total Amount


### 🏷️ Membership Discounts
Discounts are only applicable to purchases with a total amount of **₱10,000.00 and above**.

| Membership Type | Discount Rate |
|------------------|----------------|
| Silver           | 5% of total amount          |
| Gold             | 10%  of total amount        |
| Platinum         | 15%  of total amount        |

## 📦 Database Setup Instructions for Collaborators
This project uses a local SQL Server `.mdf` file for development, but `.mdf` files aren't good for version control (Git) because:

* `.mdf` files are **binary**, so Git can't track changes or merge properly.
* They're often **locked** by SQL Server or Visual Studio.
* Git may show errors like `Permission Denied` or `unable to process path`.

### ✅ Instead of syncing `.mdf` via Git...
We are using a folder called **`/DatabaseScripts`** inside the project. This contains SQL files for:
* Creating tables
* Inserting seed data
* Adding stored procedures

---

## 🚀 How to Set Up the Database Locally
1. Open **SQL Server Management Studio** or use Visual Studio's **Server Explorer**.
2. Create a new local database manually (e.g., `SalesAndInventoryDB`).
3. Open the `.sql` files inside `/DatabaseScripts`.
4. Execute them in the correct order:
   * `01_CreateTables.sql`
   * `02_InsertSeedData.sql`
   * `03_StoredProcedures.sql` (if any)
Once done, your database will match the current project structure, and the app will work normally.

---
## 🔁 Keeping the Database in Sync
If you:
* Add a new table
* Modify columns
* Insert default data
* Add a stored procedure

➡️ Please update or add a new `.sql` file in the `DatabaseScripts` folder so we can all stay in sync.
Avoid pushing `.mdf` and `.ldf` files to Git. They are **excluded in `.gitignore`** for safety.
